## About Me
I do things with lambda calculus. Mostly on natural language. Mostly. Some of them are lispy things. (See the nascent [Frege](https://github.com/emacsomancer/frege) package.)

Many of my current projects are involved with Emacs, but in general I am interested in a range of things, from terminal emulators (see [Equake](https://github.com/emacsomancer/equake)) to personal data and information management, retrieval, and visualisation (see [Org-Daily-Reflection](https://github.com/emacsomancer/org-daily-reflection) and [Sysinfo and Environs](https://github.com/emacs-bigtop/sysinfo-environs)).

But I'm also just generally interested in getting things to do things (e.g., [make Emacs think some of its frames are quake-style drop-down terminals](https://github.com/emacsomancer/equake), or Mullvad Wireguard [VPN portals be corralled by Common Lisp within an systray icon](https://github.com/emacsomancer/volemad)).

![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=emacsomancer&hide=tree-sitter%20query&langs_count=10)

I have specialised advanced training in Linguistics (PhD, Illinois, 2011) and Cognitive Science (MA, Johns Hopkins, 2004), and work especially on issues of formal semantics and its interaction with syntax, as well as language variation/change, formulaic language/templatic language, and quantity- and temporal-related particles. [See further: https://lambda-y.net ]

I have experience in a number of languages, from BASIC to C to #Python to #Lua, but am particularly interested in Lisp/Lisp-family/Lisp-like languages, including especially #CommonLisp, #GuileScheme, #Racket, #Fennel, #Clojure and #ClojureScript.
