** About Me
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: about-me
:END:
I do things with lambda calculus (sometimes on natural language, sometimes they are lispy things, occasionally both), and shell scripts, and other formal languages (logical, programming), often dealing with messy interfaces (both biological and electronic).

Many of my current projects are involved with Emacs, but in general I am interested in a range of things, from terminal emulators (see [[https://github.com/emacsomancer/equake][Equake]]) to personal data and information management, retrieval, and visualisation (see [[https://github.com/emacsomancer/org-daily-reflection][Org-Daily-Reflection]] and [[https://github.com/emacs-bigtop/sysinfo-environs][Sysinfo and Environs]] and [[https://github.com/emacsomancer/pdffontetc][PDF-fonts+metadata-in-Emacs]]) to the implementation of formal systems, especially lambda calculus (see the nascent [[https://github.com/emacsomancer/frege][Frege]] utility and my posts on [[https://babbagefiles.xyz/categories/lambdacalculus/][lambda calculus]] and [[https://babbagefiles.xyz/tags/recursion/][recursion]]).

But I'm also just generally interested in getting things to do things.  E.g., [[https://github.com/emacsomancer/equake][make Emacs think some of its frames are quake-style drop-down terminals]], or automate having [[https://github.com/emacsomancer/full-zfs-and-full-luks-encryption-on-void-linux][full disk encryption on ZFS root on Void Linux]], or make Mullvad Wireguard [[https://github.com/emacsomancer/volemad][VPN portals be corralled by Common Lisp within an systray icon]], or implement a [[https://github.com/emacsomancer/frege][(Linguistically-Typed) Lambda Calculus]] (=t=, =e=, =<e,t>=, =<e,<e,t>>= &c.) using the Racket turnstile language module* to make a DSL, or have a clean way to [[https://github.com/emacsomancer/emacs-guix-sudoloop-pull-ups][update various Guix System components painlessly in one go from Emacs]], or have a [[https://github.com/emacsomancer/vpnd][systray icon tracking available package updates on Void Linux]], or be able to [[https://github.com/emacsomancer/collaborative-writing-environment-emacs][collaboratively and interactively edit a single Emacs buffer on two different machines]], or have a [[https://babbagefiles.xyz/no-one-can-be-told-what-irc-is-you-have-to-logon-for-yourself/][clean, simple, and persistent IRC setup available via Emacs and mobile]].

I have specialised advanced training in Linguistics (PhD, Illinois, 2011) and Cognitive Science (MA, Johns Hopkins, 2004), and work especially on issues of formal semantics and its interaction with syntax, as well as language variation/change, formulaic language/templatic language, and quantity- and temporal-related particles. [For more on my academic training and papers/talks, see https://lambda-y.net ]

I have experience in a number of languages, from BASIC to C to Python to Lua, but am particularly interested in Lisp/Lisp-family/Lisp-like languages, including especially [[https://github.com/CodyReichert/awesome-cl][Common Lisp]]†, [[https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/][Guile]]‡ and other [[https://github.com/schemedoc/awesome-scheme][Schemes]], [[https://racket-lang.org/][Racket]], [[https://fennel-lang.org/][Fennel]], [[https://clojure.org/][Clojure]] and [[https://clojurescript.org/][ClojureScript]].

​*: Racket Turnstile library: [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/turnstile/]]

†: Including the wonderful window mangage [[https://stumpwm.github.io/][StumpWM]], written in and endlessly extendable using Common Lisp.

‡: Including the Guile-centric OS, [[https://guix.gnu.org/][Guix]], which I have contributed packages to, and maintain [[https://github.com/emacsomancer/guix-jittery-miscellany][a channel of not-yet-upstreamed things]]...
