** About Me
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: about-me
:END:
I do things with lambda calculus (sometimes on natural language, sometimes they
are lispy things, occasionally both), and shell scripts, and other formal
languages (logical, programming), often dealing with messy interfaces (both
biological and electronic).

Many of my current projects are involved with Emacs, but in general I am
interested in a range of things, from terminal emulators (see [[https://github.com/emacsomancer/equake][Equake]]) to
personal data and information management, retrieval, and visualisation (see
[[https://github.com/emacsomancer/org-daily-reflection][Org-Daily-Reflection]] and [[https://github.com/emacs-bigtop/sysinfo-environs][Sysinfo and Environs]] and [[https://github.com/emacsomancer/pdffontetc][PDF-fonts+metadata-in-Emacs]])
to the implementation of formal systems, especially lambda calculus (see the
nascent [[https://github.com/emacsomancer/frege][Frege]] utility and my posts on [[https://babbagefiles.xyz/categories/lambdacalculus/][lambda calculus]] and [[https://babbagefiles.xyz/tags/recursion/][recursion]]).

But I'm also just generally interested in getting things to do things.  E.g.,
[[https://github.com/emacsomancer/equake][make Emacs think some of its frames are quake-style drop-down terminals]], or
automate having [[https://github.com/emacsomancer/full-zfs-and-full-luks-encryption-on-void-linux][full disk encryption on ZFS root on Void Linux]], or make Mullvad
Wireguard [[https://github.com/emacsomancer/volemad][VPN portals be corralled by Common Lisp within an systray icon]], or
implement a [[https://github.com/emacsomancer/frege][(Linguistically-Typed) Lambda Calculus]] (=t=,=e=,=<e,t>=,=<e,<e,t>>=
&c.) using the Racket turnstile language module* to make a DSL, or have a clean
way to [[https://github.com/emacsomancer/emacs-guix-sudoloop-pull-ups][update various Guix System components painlessly in one go from Emacs]], or
have a [[https://github.com/emacsomancer/vpnd][systray icon tracking available package updates on Void Linux]], or be able
to [[https://github.com/emacsomancer/collaborative-writing-environment-emacs][collaboratively and interactively edit a single Emacs buffer on two different
machines]], or have a [[https://babbagefiles.xyz/no-one-can-be-told-what-irc-is-you-have-to-logon-for-yourself/][clean, simple, and persistent IRC setup available via Emacs
and mobile]].

I have specialised advanced training in Linguistics (PhD, Illinois, 2011) and
Cognitive Science (MA, Johns Hopkins, 2004), and work especially on issues of
formal semantics and its interaction with syntax, as well as language
variation/change, formulaic language/templatic language, and quantity- and
temporal-related particles. [For more on my academic training and papers/talks,
see https://lambda-y.net ]

I have experience in a number of languages, from BASIC to C to Python to Lua,
but am particularly interested in Lisp/Lisp-family/Lisp-like languages,
including especially [[https://github.com/CodyReichert/awesome-cl][Common Lisp]]†, [[https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/][Guile]]‡ and other [[https://github.com/schemedoc/awesome-scheme][Schemes]], [[https://racket-lang.org/][Racket]], [[https://fennel-lang.org/][Fennel]],
[[https://clojure.org/][Clojure]] and [[https://clojurescript.org/][ClojureScript]].

*: Racket Turnstile library: [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/turnstile/]]

†: Including the wonderful window mangage
[[https://stumpwm.github.io/][StumpWM]], written in and endlessly
extendable using Common Lisp.

‡: Including the Guile-centric OS, [[https://guix.gnu.org/][Guix]], which I have contributed packages to,
and maintain [[https://github.com/emacsomancer/guix-jittery-miscellany][a channel of not-yet-upstreamed things]]...
